      You will now begin the memory experiment. We will first present you with pairs of words (e.g. chair-wall) for 4 seconds each. Please study these word pairs, such that you can recall the second word ('wall') when presented the first word ('chair').
    </p>
    <p>
      After the study period, you will be given two test cycles with the same list of words. During each test cycle you will be given the first word ('chair' -- ????) and you will be asked to type in the second word ('wall'). You will have about 5 seconds to respond. After this period, you will given the correct answer for 4 seconds for feedback and restudy purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After you go through the second testing cycle, we want you to relax and go through your normal sleep routine. In the morning after you awake please log in again for the completion of this study.

    We are interested in the relationship between characteristics of your sleep pattern/quality and memory performance.
    There has been accumulating evidence that deep stages of sleep are related to better memory performance.
